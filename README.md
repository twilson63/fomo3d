# fomo3d

FOMO 3d is a fun little game where users transfer their CRED to the game and it counts down for 15 minutes, the last user to transfer the last CRED, takes all of the treasury.

```
FOMO = "_dvu9j0hm5_bZzvnnNOnjXAtBXxz9ToMMnHx9yujnrw"
```

## Transfer a CRED

```
CRED = "Sa0iBLPNyJQrwpTTG-tWLQU-1QeUAJA73DdxGGiKoJc"
Send({Target = CRED, Action = "Transfer", Quantity = "1000", Recipient = "FOMO"})
```
